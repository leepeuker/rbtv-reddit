# rbtv-reddit
A collection of reddit bots for www.reddit.com/r/rocketbeans

#### Installation and configuration:
*Instructions are for a linux based OS with git, node and npm installed.*

1. Clone Repo: `git clone https://github.com/leepeuker/rbtv-reddit`
2. Install dependencies:  `cd rbtv-reddit && npm install`
3. Configure app in 'config/default.json'
4. Run app in the foreground with `node app.js` or as a background process with `npm start`
5. Logs generated by node (eg if app crashes) can be found in 'logs/app.log', logs generated by the app can be found in 'logs/main.log'

#### Config tips
- You can rename a configured reddit account (change 'account_1' to whatever you want, don't forget to replace the old name in the bot sections) 
- You can configure multiple reddit accounts
- To use a reddit account you need a clientId and the clientSecret. You need to register the app to get these. Go to https://old.reddit.com/prefs/apps/ and select "Create another app...", give it a name, choose the "script" option and provide an 'redirect uri'
- You can change the subreddit a bot posts to for testing (change "subreddit" to whatever subreddit you want)
- The schedule statement follows the standard crontab syntax

#### To-do:
- Better Error Handling
- Tests
